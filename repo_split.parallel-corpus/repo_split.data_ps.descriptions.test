'Returns the MD5 checksum in hex for the given content. If \'content\' DCNL is a file-like object, the content will be obtained from its read() DCNL method. If \'content\' is a file path, that file is read and its DCNL contents used. Otherwise, \'content\' is assumed to be the string whose DCNL checksum is desired. If the content is unicode, it will be encoded DCNL using the specified encoding. DCNL To conserve memory, files and file-like objects will be read in blocks, DCNL with the default block size of 8192 bytes, which is 64 * the digest block DCNL size of md5 (128). This is optimal for most cases, but you can change this DCNL by passing in a different value for `block_size`.'

'Returns the total bytes for the specified path, optionally ignoring DCNL any files which match the \'ignore\' parameter. \'ignore\' can either be DCNL a single string pattern, or a list of such patterns.'
'Adds an instance method to an object.'
'When changing the state of an object, it will commonly be in a transitional DCNL state until the change is complete. This will reload the object every DCNL `interval` seconds, and check its `att` attribute until the `desired` value DCNL is reached, or until the maximum number of attempts is reached. The updated DCNL object is returned. It is up to the calling program to check the returned DCNL object to make sure that it successfully reached the desired state. DCNL Once the desired value of the attribute is reached, the method returns. If DCNL not, it will re-try until the attribute\'s value matches one of the DCNL `desired` values. By default (attempts=0) it will loop infinitely until the DCNL attribute reaches the desired value. You can optionally limit the number of DCNL times that the object is reloaded by passing a positive value to DCNL `attempts`. If the attribute has not reached the desired value by then, the DCNL method will exit. DCNL If `verbose` is True, each attempt will print out the current value of the DCNL watched attribute and the time that has elapsed since the original request. DCNL Also, if `verbose_atts` is specified, the values of those attributes will DCNL also be output. If `verbose` is False, then `verbose_atts` has no effect. DCNL Note that `desired` can be a list of values; if the attribute becomes equal DCNL to any of those values, this will succeed. For example, when creating a new DCNL cloud server, it will initially have a status of \'BUILD\', and you can\'t DCNL work with it until its status is \'ACTIVE\'. However, there might be a DCNL problem with the build process, and the server will change to a status of DCNL \'ERROR\'. So for this case you need to set the `desired` parameter to DCNL `[\'ACTIVE\', \'ERROR\']`. If you simply pass \'ACTIVE\' as the desired state, DCNL this will loop indefinitely if a build fails, as the server will never DCNL reach a status of \'ACTIVE\'. DCNL Since this process of waiting can take a potentially long time, and will DCNL block your program\'s execution until the desired state of the object is DCNL reached, you may specify a callback function. The callback can be any DCNL callable that accepts a single parameter; the parameter it receives will be DCNL either the updated object (success), or None (failure). If a callback is DCNL specified, the program will return immediately after spawning the wait DCNL process in a separate thread.'
'Loops until either the desired value of the attribute is reached, or the DCNL number of attempts is exceeded.'
'Designed to handle the most common use case for wait_until: an object whose DCNL \'status\' attribute will end up in either \'ACTIVE\' or \'ERROR\' state. Since DCNL builds don\'t happen very quickly, the interval will default to 20 seconds DCNL to avoid excess polling.'
'Attempts to parse a string representation of a date or datetime value, and DCNL returns a datetime if successful. If not, a InvalidDateTimeString exception DCNL will be raised.'
'Takes either a date, datetime or a string, and returns the standard ISO DCNL formatted string for that date/time, with any fractional second portion DCNL removed.'
'Takes either a date, a datetime, or a string, and returns a string that DCNL represents the value in RFC 2822 format. If a string is passed it is DCNL returned unchanged.'

'Adds additional text to an exception\'s error message.

'Compute the geometric mean DCNL The geometric mean (G-mean) is the root of the product of class-wise DCNL sensitivity. This measure tries to maximize the accuracy on each of the DCNL classes while keeping these accuracies balanced.

For multi-class problems it is a higher root of the DCNL product of sensitivity for each class. DCNL For compatibility with other imbalance performance measures, G-mean can be DCNL calculated for each class separately on a one-vs-rest basis when DCNL ``average != \'multiclass\'``. DCNL The best value is 1 and the worst value is 0. Traditionally if at least one DCNL class is unrecognized by the classifier, G-mean resolves to zero.

Vectors violating the DCNL constraint are rescaled so that they are within the allowed range.

DCNL max_norm : scalar DCNL This value sets the maximum allowed value of any norm in DCNL `tensor_var`. DCNL norm_axes : sequence (list or tuple) DCNL The axes over which to compute the norm.  This overrides the DCNL default norm axes defined for the number of dimensions DCNL in `tensor_var`. When this is not specified and `tensor_var` is a DCNL matrix (2D), this is set to `(0,)`. If `tensor_var` is a 3D, 4D or DCNL 5D tensor, it is set to a tuple listing all axes but axis 0.

'channelwise 2D convolution with unshared weights, no stride, DCNL \'same\' padding, no dilation and no bias'
'Execute a batch of a stack of N-dimensional convolutions. DCNL Parameters DCNL input : numpy array DCNL kernel : numpy array DCNL pad : {0, \'valid\', \'same\', \'full\'}, int or tuple of int DCNL stride : int or tuple of int DCNL n : int DCNL Returns DCNL numpy array'
'Inserts `factors[i] - 1` zeros between input elements on axis i.'
